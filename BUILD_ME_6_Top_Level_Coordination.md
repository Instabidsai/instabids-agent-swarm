# üåä INSTABIDS HOMEOWNER AGENT SWARM

This repository contains the complete source code for the InstaBids Homeowner Agent Swarm, the proof-of-concept for the world's first living AI organism.

## ü§ñ QUICK START FOR AI AGENTS
- **Build Order:** First, run all `SETUP ME` documents. Then, populate all `BUILD ME` documents.
- **Critical Rules:**
  - ‚ùå **NO** direct agent communication (use Redis Streams only).
  - üõ°Ô∏è Contact protection is **ABSOLUTE**.
  - üí∞ Cost limits are enforced programmatically.

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY
- **Run Tests:** `python -m pytest tests/`
- **Security Mandate:** Contact protection tests must maintain 100% pass rate.

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT
- Use `docker-compose up --build` to run the system locally after setup.
```

# Agent Build Assignments & Paths

This document is a reference for the logical separation of concerns within the swarm.

- **AGENT 1: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE** (`core/`, `deployment/`)
- **AGENT 2: HOMEOWNER INTAKE** (`agents/homeowner_intake/`)
- **AGENT 3: PROJECT SCOPE** (`agents/project_scope/`)
- **AGENT 4: COMMUNICATION FILTER** (`agents/communication_filter/`)
- **AGENT 5: PAYMENT GATE** (`agents/payment_gate/`)
- **AGENT 6: UI GENERATOR & FRONTEND** (`agents/ui_generator/`, `ui/`)
