# 🌊 INSTABIDS HOMEOWNER AGENT SWARM

This repository contains the complete source code for the InstaBids Homeowner Agent Swarm, the proof-of-concept for the world's first living AI organism.

## 🤖 QUICK START FOR AI AGENTS
- **Build Order:** First, run all `SETUP ME` documents. Then, populate all `BUILD ME` documents.
- **Critical Rules:**
  - ❌ **NO** direct agent communication (use Redis Streams only).
  - 🛡️ Contact protection is **ABSOLUTE**.
  - 💰 Cost limits are enforced programmatically.

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY
- **Run Tests:** `python -m pytest tests/`
- **Security Mandate:** Contact protection tests must maintain 100% pass rate.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT
- Use `docker-compose up --build` to run the system locally after setup.
